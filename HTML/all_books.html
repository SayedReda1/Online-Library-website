                <strong>About this book</strong> <br />
                Beginning with the untimely death of a young mother, A History of a
                cGMP Medical Event Investigation unfolds a fictitious case study that
                captures how <br />
                unchecked human flaws during the development and launch of a new drug
                can lead to disastrous consequences.
